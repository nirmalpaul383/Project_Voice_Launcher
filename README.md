and rebuilt it. To download the project source file visit my GitHub profile https://www.github.com/nirmalpaul383/

About source project:
This application is made with Tasker: (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) and
with Tasker app factory (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory ).
To install and run 'Voice Launcher' you will not need any of this application. However, if you want to ‘view’ or ‘modify’
source file you 'will need' Tasker application and if you want to 'export your own modification' then you 'will need both'
Tasker and its extension app Tasker app factory.
